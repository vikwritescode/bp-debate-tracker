# BP Debate Tracker

This is a python program which is designed to use a URL and a name to keep track of BP speeches for speakers. Current work in progress.

## What is this repo?
This is the backend code for my BP debate tracker. Currently, this uses sqlite to store BP debate records. These records are created and fetched using an API. This program uses fastAPI, which allows authenicated users to fetch and record information that is debate related.

This, at the moment, also allows for records to be made through simply a URL and a name, instead of adding the results of all of the rounds manually. 

## Features
- Import from URL
- Get position wide averages
- View Debates Individually
- Sign Up and Login

## Coming Soon
- Add Individual Records
- Delete Records
- Display Average and Standard Deviation of Speaks
